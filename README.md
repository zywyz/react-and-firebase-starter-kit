# React & firebase starter kit

Starter template for react and firebase SPA.

## Features

- ES6
- react/jsx
- react-router
- redux
- webpack
- browser-sync
- firebase
- sass
- eslint (with [airbnb rules](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for js and react)
- mocha/chai for js tests
- [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) for react tests

Development and build tasks are done with gulp so there are no problem to replace for example sass with less etc.
